Is Polish difficult?
It migth be, but when you have a goal declared for 2022, you find the best and
fun way to do it. My goal for this 2022 is to communicate with my parents in law
in polish when they are visiting us in Colombia this june 2022.

How will I make ?
As I love R, I will try to learng polish using R.

`starting_date <- lubridate::ymd("2022-01-14")`

```{r}
words_learned <- list(
        greetings = c("cześć", "pa", "dzien dobry", "dobranoc", "dowidzenia"),
        food = c("chleb", "jablko", "mleko", "kabanos", "sok", "kapusta",
                "pomarancza", "ciasto", "kawa", "woda", "wódka"),
        animals = c("pies", "kot", "biedronka"),
        most_used = c("nie", "tak", "dziekuje", "prosze", "troszke/ troche",
                "Przepraszam", "drogo"),
        tranportation = c("samochód", "lot", "metro", "autobus")
)
```
