# My own web page ainsuasty.com üë®‚Äçüíº

I started building my webpage on 2020. All source code is on github  [ainsuasty.com](https://github.com/ainsu23/ainsuasty.com).

The template **hugo-coder** was chosen from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). A forked 
version is on my github where I changed the family-font from fonts.google.com. 
This forked version is a submodule of the ainsuasty.com repository.

A good guideline to create smart websites is the book written by *Yihui Xie* [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

ainsuasty.com contains:

-   *About:* Information about me and my personal likes.
-   *Blog (EN / ES):* Explains tricks about R.
-   *Projects:* Projects where I have been involved.
-   *Contact me:* Contact information.
-   *resume:* resume developed in R with *datadrivencv* [ver repositorio en github](https://github.com/ainsu23/resume). This was forked and used as a submodule.
