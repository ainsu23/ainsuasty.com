My name is **Andrés Felipe Insuasty Ch.**, I love working with *R* for data analysis. I am from Cali (Capital of salsa dancing 💃), Colombia. I lived in Bogotá but I travel a lot around the world with my girlfriend **Klaudia** 😍. I have had experience using R since my master degree (graduated in 2015). This involve **getting + wragling + automatic reports** for 3 different companies. Finally, I have taught to use R to my team at my previous work.

## PROJECTS 📖

As long as I can't show you my projects done in my previous works, I have created own projects with public data in order to describe my passion for data.
